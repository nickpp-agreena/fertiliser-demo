# Antigravity Skill Creator

## When to use this skill
- When the user asks to "create a skill" or "add a capability".
- When you need to standardize a new consistent workflow.
- When creating "meta-skills" (skills that build skills).

## Workflow
1.  **Analyze Request**: Determine the skill's purpose, triggers, and necessary components (scripts, templates).
2.  **Define Structure**: Plan the folder hierarchy (`SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `resources/`).
3.  **Draft Content**: Write the `SKILL.md` following the "Claude Way" principles (conciseness, progressive disclosure).
4.  **Validate**: Ensure YAML frontmatter is strictly formatted and the naming convention (gerund) is followed.
5.  **Output**: Present the skill in the defined "Output Template" or directly create the files.

## Instructions

### 1. Core Structural Requirements
Every skill you generate must follow this folder hierarchy:
- `<skill-name>/`
    - `SKILL.md` (Required: Main logic and instructions)
    - `scripts/` (Optional: Helper scripts)
    - `examples/` (Optional: Reference implementations)
    - `resources/` (Optional: Templates or assets)

### 2. YAML Frontmatter Standards
The `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter following these strict rules:
- **name**: Gerund form (e.g., `testing-code`, `managing-databases`). Max 64 chars. Lowercase, numbers, and hyphens only. No "claude" or "anthropic" in the name.
- **description**: Written in **third person**. Must include specific triggers/keywords. Max 1024 chars. (e.g., "Extracts text from PDFs. Use when the user mentions document processing or PDF files.")

### 3. Writing Principles (The "Claude Way")
When writing the body of `SKILL.md`, adhere to these best practices:

* **Conciseness**: Assume the agent is smart. Do not explain what a PDF or a Git repo is. Focus only on the unique logic of the skill.
* **Progressive Disclosure**: Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. If more detail is needed, link to secondary files (e.g., `[See ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md)`) only one level deep.
* **Forward Slashes**: Always use `/` for paths, never `\`.
* **Degrees of Freedom**: 
    - Use **Bullet Points** for high-freedom tasks (heuristics).
    - Use **Code Blocks** for medium-freedom (templates).
    - Use **Specific Bash Commands** for low-freedom (fragile operations).

### 4. Feedback Loops & Safety
For complex tasks, include:
- **Checklists**: A markdown checklist the agent can copy and update to track state.
- **Validation Loops**: A "Plan-Validate-Execute" pattern (e.g., Run a script to check a config file BEFORE applying changes).
- **Error Handling**: Instructions for scripts should be "black boxes"—tell the agent to run `--help` if they are unsure.

## Resources

### Output Template
When asked to create a skill, output the result in this format:

### [Folder Name]
**Path:** `.agent/skills/[skill-name]/`

### [SKILL.md]
```markdown
